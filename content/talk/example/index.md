abstract: "Root architecture, the temporal and spatial distribution of roots, is important for the uptake of water and nutrients. The divergent growth of roots at various classes, developmental patterns, and neighboring roots interactions can result in extensively diversified root architectures, even within the same genotype. Yet, such root architecture diversity within genotypes is largely ignored due to various reasons, of which a lack of computational tools is the most prominent. Here, we propose a shape descriptor, named DS-curves (the rate of root width changes by rooting depth), to summarize the architecture of a single root. Using DS curves as a core, we developed a new computing pipeline that combines Kmeans++ clustering, outlier filtering, and evaluation processes to classify root architectures into similar root architecture types. Subsequently, we apply this pipeline to analyze a large image dataset, which includes the roots of the three common bean (Phaselous vulgaris) genotypes DOR364 (n=874), SEQ7 (n=983) and L88_57 (n=2037) in well-watered and water-stress environments. The imaging data was collected at the Apache Root Biology Center (Willcox,Arizona) during the years 2015 and 2016 using the DIRT imaging protocol. Our first results suggest that each genotype exhibits five distinguishable root architecture types in each environment, and year. Moreover, DOR364, SEQ7, and L88_57 show consensus architecture types across years and environments, which might suggest that these architecture types might be heritable. We also observed that the ratio of root architecture types for each genotype varies among environments, which links a preference for specific architecture types to certain environments. Interestingly, the aboveground biomass does not differ significantly between root architecture types. We hypothesize that this biomass homogeneity arises from a strategy of the plant to optimize water and nutrient uptake on the population level. Based on our findings, we introduce the “Phenotypic Spectrum” as a new concept to describe the phenomenon that a single genotype can display several distinct root architecture types within or among environments. For future work, we will also investigate the effects of specific genetic or environmental causes on the variations within the phenotypic spectrum. "
